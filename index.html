            <p> The aim of this research is distinguishing the sounds of domestic cats from the sounds of domestic cats imitated by humans.<br> 
              Here you can find a set of Cat Sounds divided by 3 categories which are downloaded from FreeSound.org. <br>
              FreeSound is a platform for the collaborative creation of open audio collections labeled by humans and based on Freesound content.<br> 
To create a data set consisting of the vocalizations of the imitation cat sounds, here reference sounds were created. <br>You should listen to the combination of various clips for each category to be able to create imitations.<br> Each category approximately 20-30 seconds long and belongs to a different source. <br>You need to record 10 imitations for each cat subcategory. Duration of the imitations may vary and will be shortened if necessary.</p>
